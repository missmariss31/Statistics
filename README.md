# Stroop Effect Project

## Udacity Statistics Project
A statistical analysis of the difference between the length of time taken to read the names of colors when the name matches the color of the written word and the length of time taken to read the names of colors when the name does NOT match the color of the written word.  A one-tailed positive t-test will determine whether the difference in time between the two samples is statistically significant or not.  In other words, should we reject or accept the Null Hypothesis?
